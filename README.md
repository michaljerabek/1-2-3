# 1-2-3 â€” Number sequence generator for [Phoenix Code](http://phcode.io/) 

*GIFs below were created with an older version with a different UI, but in general it works the same. Also the shortcut `CTRL` + `B` is by default `ALT` + `F3`.*

## Basic usage

Press `CTRL`+`F11` to generate numbers. Press `ALT`+`F11` to set some options.

You can remove saved lines with `CTRL`+`ALT`+`SHIFT`+`F11`.

To ignore them, you can generate numbers with `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`F11` or `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`F11`.

The extension also adds commands into the `Edit` menu and a button into the toolbar. This can be changed in the editor preferences.
